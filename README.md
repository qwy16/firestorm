**[Finalviewer](https://www.finalviewerviewer.org) is a free client for 3D virtual worlds such as Second Life and various OpenSim worlds where users can create, connect and chat with others from around the world.**

This repository contains the official source code for the Finalviewer viewer.

## Open Source

Finalviewer is a third party viewer derived from the official [Second Life](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer) client. The client codebase has been open source since 2007 and is available under the LGPL license.

## Download

Pre-built versions of the viewer releases for Windows, Mac and Linux can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.finalviewerviewer.org/choose-your-platform/).

## Build Instructions

Build instructions for each operating system can be found using the links below and in the official [wiki](https://wiki.finalviewerviewer.org).

- [Windows](doc/building_windows.md)
- [Mac](doc/building_macos.md)
- [Linux](doc/building_linux.md)

> [!NOTE]
> We do not provide support for compiling the viewer or issues resulting from using a self-compiled viewer. However, there is a self-compilers group within Second Life that can be joined to ask questions related to compiling the viewer: [Finalviewer Self Compilers](https://tinyurl.com/finalviewer-self-compilers)

## Contribute

Help make Finalviewer better! You can get involved with improvements by filing bugs and suggesting enhancements via [JIRA](https://jira.finalviewerviewer.org) or [creating pull requests](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Community respect

This section is guided by the [TPV Policy](https://secondlife.com/corporate/third-party-viewers) and the [Second Life Code of Conduct](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer?tab=coc-ov-file).

Finalviewer code is made available during ongoing development, with the **master** branch representing the current nightly build. Developers and self-compilers are encouraged to work on their own forks and contribute back via pull requests, as detailed in the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you intend to use our code for your own viewer beyond personal use, please only use code from official release branches (for example, `Finalviewer_7.1.13`), rather than from pre-release/preview or nightly builds.
